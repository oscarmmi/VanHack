## Tell us about yourself

My name is Oscar Javier Mu√±oz Marciales, I am a web developer; I have worked as web developer about 5 years; I have worked in five different companies, and currently I am working in a full time job for a Colombian company called Marval S.A., and the other one for a Spanish called Unifema S.L. In my full time job I work making the integrations between different data sources and in my part-time job I work as a web developer for creating/supporting different online stores. 
I consider myself a great web developer and I try to improve as much as I can as a developer every day.
