## Tell us about yourself

My name is Oscar Javier Mu√±oz Marciales, I am a web developer; I have worked as web developer about 5 years; I have worked in five different companies, and currently I am working in a full time job for a Colombian company called Marval S.A., and the other one for a Spanish called Unifema S.L. In my full time job I work making the integrations between different data sources and in my part-time job I work as a web developer for creating/supporting different online stores. 
I consider myself a great web developer and I try to improve as much as I can as a developer every day. 

## Describe a technical challenge you have faced

The hardest technical challenge I have faced was one related to the electronic billing in the first company in which I worked; the main problem about that was the lack of support of the company in charge of bringing the service of integration between the company Offimedicas and the revenue agency of Colombia, DIAN. So the whole process of collecting the data and sending it to the integration provider; it was too hard because I had no support or documentation for solving the issues that were appearing during the development of this task, so the only way to finish the task was trial and error. So I had to spend a really huge amount of time because I had to deliver a perfectly tested product, and any mistake/bug could have costed a lot of money to the company. Then being under high pressure was a constant during that time.
