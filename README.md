# Answers

## 1. Tell us about yourself

My name is Oscar Javier Muñoz Marciales, I am a web developer; I have worked as web developer about 5 years; I have worked in five different companies, and currently I am working in a full time job for a Colombian company called Marval S.A., and the other one for a Spanish called Unifema S.L. In my full time job I work making the integrations between different data sources and in my part-time job I work as a web developer for creating/supporting different online stores. 
I consider myself a great web developer and I try to improve as much as I can as a developer every day. 

## 2. Describe a technical challenge you have faced

The hardest technical challenge I have faced was one related to the electronic billing in the first company in which I worked; the main problem about that was the lack of support of the company in charge of bringing the service of integration between the company Offimedicas and the revenue agency of Colombia, DIAN. So the whole process of collecting the data and sending it to the integration provider; it was too hard because I had no support or documentation for solving the issues that were appearing during the development of this task, so the only way to finish the task was trial and error. So I had to spend a really huge amount of time because I had to deliver a perfectly tested product, and any mistake/bug could have costed a lot of money to the company. Then being under high pressure was a constant during that time.


## 3. Tell us 3 questions you would ask in an interview

* ### Why do you want to join our company?

I think your company would be a huge step for my professional career, and it would bring me a huge stability in my personal and family life; Moreover it would be really great to be part of an international team that is something that I have dreamed my whole life it would be awesome to have the chance of working with people from all over the world.
Besides, I truly believe that being part of a world-class development team makes all of their team members become better developers due to the interaction with the different cultures and different levels of expertise. And all of that is what makes me want to be part of your company.


 * ### In which company would you love to join? And why?

I have no one specific name of a company in my mind; what I think about that is the fact that the company should have really exciting projects that make me feel challenged my whole time and learn new stuff or improve the knowledge that I already have. An international work team would be great, because your team can be a helping hand for your professional future and improving as a developer. And I would love to have the chance to work from home because I think the time we save commuting is really valuable; at least for me that I have a big family, so I have more time for spending with my loved ones.


* ### What field of development do you like most, or do you think it is the most exciting?

I have always worked as a web developer, I have worked as backend/frontend or full-stack; and I really enjoy doing my job, but I think in the future I would love to have the chance to prove myself as an ML developer or maybe an AI developer. I truly believe that is the future and I would love to be part of that future, and it doesn’t matter how hard it can be, I would love to show the world how I am able to do it.
